here..
we are taking input image
and secret image...

the secret image is hidden inside the input image,,.
watermarked image is obtained...


during decryption.extraction...

the secret image which is extracted from the watermarked image...


in existing it has been done for grayscale images..
in our proposed ...we did it for color images also....

the algorithm used is DWT,..and blending algorithms....
