TRAFFIC SIGN RECOGNITION USING 
CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NEYWORKS
 


The Traffic Sign Recognition project is
to build a Deep Neural Network (DNN) 
which is used to classify traffic signs. 

16 -different Classes of Traffic Signs used
CNN- classifier is used. 

1.  'No entry'
2.  'Turn left ahead'
3.  'Level crossing with barrier ahead'
4.  '40'
5.  '60'
6.  'No left turn'
7.  'No U-turn'
8.  'Horn prohibited'
9.  'No right turn'
10. 'No straight ahead'
11. '30'
12. 'STOP'
13. 'vehicles prohibited'
14. 'turn right ahead'
15. 'U_turn'
16. 'Bicycles Only'

Train Neaural Network..


Testing..

1. Test network with new image
2. Select any Image From Test Dataset(16-Types).
3. Classify and  Display Results..

Its take some time to Train System..

once it Trained Completely ..
New Diagloue box will open..

Select New Image for Testing 
Classifiy the New image and get Classified Output.
