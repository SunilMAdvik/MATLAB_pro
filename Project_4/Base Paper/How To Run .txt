SECURED DATA TRANSMISSION USING WAVELET BASED 
STEGANOGRAPHY AND CRYPTOGRAPHY BY USING
 AES ALGORITHM
 


In this paper, a method to combine
steganography (Least Significant Method) and 
cryptography (AES) is considered, so as to 
provide a more secure way for data transmission
 through any unsecured or public networks. 



Steps- Encryption 

1. Select Data to be Hided "Hide_Data"(16-bytes)


2. Encrypt Plain_Text into Chiper_Text
   using AES-128 bit Encryption


3. Select Any image (Cover_Image) 
    To hide the Chiper Text in Image 

4. Hide The Data.





Steps- Decryption

1. Extract the Hided Data From Stego_Image

2. Decrypt the Chiper_Text to Get Original Plain_Text
   using AES-128 bit Decryption.
