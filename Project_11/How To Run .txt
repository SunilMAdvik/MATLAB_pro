based on morphological operations

Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) systems have become 
an important tool to track stolen cars, accesscontrol, and monitor traffic.

The present algorithm is able to accurately detect and 
differentiate license plates in complex images. This method was
 first tested through MATLAB with an on-line public database of
Greek number plates and was 100% accurate in all clear images, 
and achieved 98.45% accuracy when using the entire
database which included complex backgrounds and
 license plates obscured by shadow and dirt.

Steps 

1. Run " Localization-maaain.m"code 

   we implented the localization of license plate algorithm on
   color, gray , difficlut  background also
   
  license plate can be detected and localized 
  using bounding box using morphological operations
  
2. Run" Recogniation- Main.m"
   
license plate can be detected and localized
 using bounding box using morphological operations

then Alpha- Numeric letters are recognised
