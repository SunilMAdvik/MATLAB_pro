license plate recognition and text extraction

we can give running video of car as input or
we can take a snap from running video..

if we give video as input, video needs to convert
into frames...we need to select a frame..

It will be severely affected by blur..
we are further adding the blur and noise in order
to increase the complexity of our work..
eventhough it gets affected by  blur ,
we are sucessfully detecting the license plate area
and extracting the characters of the license plate.
